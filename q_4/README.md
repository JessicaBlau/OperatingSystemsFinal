There is a C program that is called dir_traversal to compile this you need 
to run the makefile first with the command make. After it has compiled you will 
need to add the directory you want to run to this directory. After it is added you 
need to run ./dir_traversal <dirctoryName>. In my example i created the directory dir with 
different files in it and ran ./dir_traversal dir and the output is the type it is, inode, and the name.
